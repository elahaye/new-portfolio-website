        <h2>JS Developer looking for a job !</h2>
        <p>
          Having lived in Paris, London, Tokyo, and Montreal, I've decided to return to beloved
          France, set my suitcase down and enjoy time with friends and family. Transitioning to web
          development 4 years ago, I primarily worked with Angular 2+, but I'm open to all
          JavaScript-oriented roles. If you're seeking a motivated developer, please don't hesitate
          to reach out.
        </p>
